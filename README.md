# crypto-rebalancer

Inspired by an article by shrimpy explaining what portfolio rebalancing is. The idea is that by periodically rebalancing the value of each currency held to maintain the same share of the total portfolio value, over time the value of the portfolio will increase more than if it had been left untouched over the same period of time.

## Progress/Plan

- ~~Initial application set up, planning for hexagonal architecture~~
- ~~Portfolio domain, model and interfaces for basic CRUD functionality~~
- ~~Memory storage to implement repo interface~~
- ~~rest handlers to invoke functionality via HTTP calls~~
- ~~Persistent storage via DB~~
- Assets domain to create and update asset prices
- Rebalancing implementation
- Automatically running, testing with historic data
